# Python_Dice_Game
A short easy dice game

Open a terminal and use $python3 dicegame.py
For extra fun, make a duplicate program with random range of 3-7 and play aginst a sibling

Make sure the dice gif files remain in the same folder as the dicegame.py file, otherwise the program will fail.

You will need a Python environment to run this game. I reccomend Anaconda for fastest and easiest install of Python
Going directly to python.org works as well.
